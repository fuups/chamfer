# Chamfer Playgrounds

App workspaces for exercising Chamfer tokens and utilities across different stacks.

- `html/html` – static HTML + vanilla JS theme toggle.
- `html/tailwind` – static HTML rendered with the Chamfer Tailwind utility bundle.
- `react/react` – React 19 showcase consuming core CSS directly.
- `react/tailwind` – React + Tailwind utility demo.

Each sub-app is a standalone Vite project so you can run them individually via:

```bash
pnpm --filter <workspace-name> dev
```

Refer to the README within each app for the exact workspace name.
