Chamfer UI is evolving quickly. The roadmap below captures the immediate focus areas. Timelines are aspirational and will adjust as we gather feedback.

## Near term

- Button: finalize loading spinner integration and component wrappers.
- Input & Textarea components: HTML baseline, validation states, accessibility checklist.
- Tailwind preset: expand utilities to cover layout tokens (spacing grid, typography scale).
- Docs: add theming recipes, testing strategy, and live code playgrounds.

## Mid term

- Form controls suite (Checkbox, Radio, Select) with behavior helpers.
- Feedback components (Alert, Toast) with motion-aware transitions.
- Automated accessibility tests (axe-core/Pa11y) in CI.
- Versioned documentation tied to npm releases.

## Longer term

- Theme pack presets for light/dark/high-contrast variations.
- CLI tooling for scaffolding component wrappers across frameworks.
- Design asset exports (Figma tokens) generated from the same source.
- Visual regression pipeline to guard against CSS regressions.
