description: Expectations and checklist for accessible Chamfer UI components.

Accessibility is non-negotiable for every Chamfer component. Use this baseline as a preflight checklist before shipping new work.

## Overview

- **Contrast:** tokens target WCAG 2.1 AA for text and UI indicators across light/dark/high-contrast themes.
- **Focus:** shared focus tokens guarantee visible outlines and consistent ring styling.
- **Semantics:** HTML defaults remain accessible; alternate hosts require documented `role`/`aria-*` attributes.
- **Motion:** progressive enhancements respect user preferences and can be disabled per instance.

## Contrast & theming

- Targets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast by default (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI indicators).
- Light/dark tokens provide equivalent contrast; high-contrast tokens (`--ch-*-hcm-*`) keep Windows High Contrast legible.
- Tailwind utilities mirror semantic tokens so contrast remains consistent regardless of styling approach.

## Focus management

- All focusable elements expose a visible focus ring using shared tokens: `--ch-focus-accent`, `--ch-focus-outer`, `--ch-ring-*`.
- `:focus-visible` is the default; in environments lacking support, wrappers can polyfill via `focus-visible` ponyfill if needed.
- Focus styles must not rely solely on color; outline and shadow ensure clarity.

## Semantic structure

- Components render semantic HTML by default (`<button>`, `<input>`, `<nav>`, etc.).
- When alternative elements are used (e.g., `<a role="button">`), docs mandate appropriate `role`, `aria-*`, and `tabindex`.
- Slots (`data-slot` / `.ch-button__leading`) avoid communicating meaning purely with anonymous spans.

## Reduced motion & behaviors

- Ripple/animation helpers respect `prefers-reduced-motion`, falling back to no animation when users opt out.
- Behaviors are optional; disabling them should not break component semantics.

## Assistive tech support

- Icon-only controls require `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- Loading states propagate `aria-busy` and suspend pointer/keyboard interaction.
- Error states expose `aria-live` regions only when necessary to avoid announcement spam.

## Checklist

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Keyboard access (Tab/Shift+Tab/Space/Enter) | Required |
| Visible focus on all interactive elements | Required |
| Text & UI contrast meet AA | Required |
| `prefers-reduced-motion` respected | Required |
| Icon-only controls have accessible names | Required |
| High-contrast mode (HCM) snapshot verified | Required |

## Next steps

1. Follow the [Quick Start](/foundations/quick-start) guide to confirm ripple helpers and focus styles are wired correctly in your stack.
2. Reference component-specific docs (for example [Button](/components/button)) for detailed keyboard tables and state notes.
3. Capture manual/automated test results in your PR description so reviewers can trace accessibility validation.

As new components ship, supplement this baseline with component-specific guidance (for example form error messaging or ARIA patterns) so teams can validate quickly.
