Chamfer UI is grounded in four principles that shape every token, component, and documentation decision. Use them to evaluate new work and to keep future contributions aligned with the system.

## Overview

- **Clarity** - interfaces should be legible, discoverable, and predictable.
- **Consistency** - tokens and components share contracts so theming remains stable.
- **Flexibility** - adapt to new contexts without forking or rewriting.
- **Accessibility** - inclusive defaults are the baseline, not an optional extra.

## Principles

### Clarity

- Semantic token names (for example `--ch-action-primary-soft-fg`) communicate meaning instead of hex codes.
- Component docs ship with HTML baselines, callouts, and tables so engineers know exactly which attributes and modifiers to use.
- Contrast, focus outlines, and high-contrast fallbacks are baked into the core CSS.

### Consistency

- Tokens flow primitives → semantic → component, preventing ad-hoc overrides.
- Components never reference primitives directly; they rely on semantic aliases so brand updates propagate automatically.
- Framework adapters output identical markup/attributes, ensuring React/Vue/Angular stay in sync with the vanilla contract.

### Flexibility

- Density scaling, Tailwind utilities, and token overrides make it easy to adapt components to dashboards, marketing sites, or native wrappers.
- Progressive enhancement helpers are optional (the HTML works standalone), so teams can opt in to behavior only where needed.
- Playgrounds and docs reuse the same artifacts as production builds, reducing drift.

### Accessibility

- Components expose semantic HTML and document required `aria-*` attributes for alternate hosts (like anchors posing as buttons).
- Behaviors respect user preferences (`prefers-reduced-motion`, forced-colors) and ship with defaults that meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast.
- Every doc page includes accessibility checklists so states (focus, hover, loading, disabled) are reviewed before release.

## Applying the principles

1. **Plan**: start with tokens and anatomy-does the component expose a clear contract?
2. **Build**: rely on semantic tokens, reusable helpers, and the progressive enhancement layer.
3. **Document**: capture usage, states, and accessibility notes so adopters can succeed without reading the source.

Reference these principles whenever you add a new component or adjust an existing one; they act as the shared rubric for code review, docs review, and design alignment.
