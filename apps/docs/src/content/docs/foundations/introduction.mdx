Chamfer UI is a framework-agnostic component system focused on accessibility, semantic theming, and predictable design tokens. The monorepo is organised into pnpm workspaces so you can opt into just the layers you need-tokens, core CSS, progressive enhancement helpers, and framework wrappers.

## Package landscape

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@chamfer/tokens` | Design tokens emitted as CSS, JSON, and TypeScript metadata. |
| `@chamfer/core` | Framework-agnostic CSS bundle composed from semantic tokens. |
| `@chamfer/behavior` | Progressive enhancement helpers (ripple, focus management, etc.). |
| `@chamfer/{react,vue,angular}` | Framework adapters that wrap the core CSS + behaviors. |
| `@chamfer/tailwind` | Tailwind preset + CSS utilities mapped to Chamfer tokens. |

## Documentation structure

- **Foundations** – principles, quick-start, tokens & theming, tooling.
- **Components** – per-component specs with HTML baselines, behavior notes, and framework usage.
- **Guides** (planned) – accessibility checklist, theming recipes, integration patterns.

Each component page links back to the relevant foundation topics so you can understand both the “how” and the “why” behind the implementation.
