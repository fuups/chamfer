Chamfer UI is a framework-agnostic component system designed around accessibility, semantic theming, and predictable design tokens. The pnpm monorepo lets you opt into only the layers you need-tokens, core CSS, progressive enhancement helpers, or framework wrappers-without duplicating configuration.

## Overview

- **Philosophy:** ship accessible HTML first, layer on progressive enhancement, and keep design tokens semantic so rebranding stays predictable.
- **Distribution:** each layer publishes under the `@chamfer/*` namespace; you can install a single package or the full stack.
- **Documentation:** foundations provide the “why”, component pages document the contract, and upcoming guides capture integration recipes.

## Package landscape

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@chamfer/tokens` | Design tokens emitted as CSS, JSON, and TypeScript metadata. |
| `@chamfer/core` | Framework-agnostic CSS bundle composed from semantic tokens. |
| `@chamfer/behavior` | Progressive enhancement helpers (ripple, focus management, etc.). |
| `@chamfer/{react,vue,angular}` | Framework adapters that wrap the core CSS + behaviors. |
| `@chamfer/tailwind` | Tailwind preset + CSS utilities mapped to Chamfer tokens. |

## Repository layout

- `packages/` - publishable workspaces (tokens, core, behavior, framework adapters, Tailwind utilities).
- `apps/docs` - Astro documentation site consuming the published artifacts.
- `apps/playground/*` - HTML and framework playgrounds for local QA.
- `configs/` - shared ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier, PostCSS, and TS configs referenced by every package.

## Documentation structure

- **Foundations** - principles, quick start, tokens & theming, typography, tooling, accessibility.
- **Components** - HTML-first specs covering semantics, variants, states, behaviors, and theming hooks.
- **Guides** (planned) - deep dives into topics like theming recipes, framework integration, and accessibility audits.

Every component page links back to the relevant foundation topics, so you can move from high-level principles to implementation details without losing context.

## Next steps

1. Walk through the [Quick Start](/foundations/quick-start) to install packages and render your first button.
2. Review the [Design Principles](/foundations/design-principles) and [Tokens & Theming](/foundations/tokens) guides to understand how styling decisions flow.
3. Explore the [Button component](/components/button) for a fully documented example of Chamfer’s contract.
