title: Tooling & Workflow
description: Development workflow, build tooling, and repository conventions for Chamfer UI.

Chamfer UI is managed as a pnpm workspace so packages share configs while shipping independently. Use this page as a cheat sheet for local development, CI, and repository conventions.

## Overview

- **pnpm workspaces** keep dependencies in sync and enable per-package commands via filters.
- **Shared configs** live in `configs/` and are imported by every package to avoid drift.
- **Build pipeline** runs tokens → core → behavior → docs/playgrounds to keep artifacts consistent.

## Workspace commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install` | Installs workspace dependencies with hoisting optimised for pnpm. |
| `pnpm -r build` | Runs `build` in every package/app (tokens → core → docs/playgrounds). |
| `pnpm --filter @chamfer/tokens build` | Generates CSS/JSON/TS token artifacts. Required before building `@chamfer/core`. |
| `pnpm --filter @chamfer/playground-html dev` | Starts the vanilla HTML playground. |
| `pnpm --filter @chamfer/docs dev` | Launches the Astro documentation site. |

## Shared configuration

All linting, formatting, and PostCSS configs live under `configs/` so packages can reuse them without duplication. Import them via relative paths (e.g., `module.exports = require("../../configs/postcss.config.cjs");`).

## Build pipeline

1. **Tokens** - generated via TypeScript scripts; outputs CSS/JSON/TS artifacts.
2. **Core CSS** - composes semantic token CSS and component sources into `/dist/css`.
3. **Behavior** - TypeScript compiled to ESM/CJS with declaration files.
4. **Framework wrappers** - (future) wrap core CSS + behaviors and emit type-safe APIs.
5. **Docs/Playgrounds** - import built artifacts to keep demos in sync with packages.

CI will run lint/tests/build per package before release. SemVer tagging is planned per package once automation is configured.

## Progressive enhancement

Vanilla JS helpers live in `@chamfer/behavior`. They are optional but recommended for features like ripple, focus overlays, or keyboard guards. Wrappers re-export these helpers so framework consumers don’t touch the DOM directly.

## Repository hygiene

- Keep component specs (`components/*.md`) updated when behavior or tokens change.
- Update `SESSION_PROGRESS.md` when large tasks land so long-running efforts remain traceable.
- Document cross-cutting decisions in `AGENTS.md` to guide future contributors and automation.

## Next steps

1. Run through the [Quick Start](/foundations/quick-start) to confirm your local environment is configured.
2. Read the [Accessibility baseline](/foundations/accessibility) so QA expectations are clear before shipping components.
3. Review the [Design Principles](/foundations/design-principles) whenever you introduce new tokens, helpers, or docs.
