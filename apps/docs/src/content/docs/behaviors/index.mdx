Chamfer ships as HTML-first components. Behaviors are optional, framework-agnostic helpers that enhance those components when JavaScript is available. They wire up features such as ripple feedback, focus management, and async loading cues without leaking framework-specific assumptions into the core CSS.

## How behaviors work

- **Opt-in:** Import the helper you need (`@chamfer/behavior`) and call it on the element you rendered. No global bootstrapping is required.
- **Progressive:** If JavaScript is disabled the component still renders and responds using native semantics.
- **Composable:** Helpers add lightweight classes and data attributes (`ch-rippling`, `data-ch-loading`) so you can layer custom styling or theming on top.
- **Accessible:** Every behavior respects user preferences like `prefers-reduced-motion` and the forced-colors media query.

## Available helpers

| Helper | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`enhanceButton`](./ripple) | Adds ripple feedback, ensures keyboard parity, and normalises type defaults for buttons. | alpha |
| Focus ring management | Dedicated helper coming soon for global focus stylings. | planned |
| Async loading coordinator | Planned helper for coordinating busy/loading states across grouped controls. | planned |

## Using a behavior

1. Install `@chamfer/behavior` alongside `@chamfer/core`.
2. Call the helper in the lifecycle that renders your element.
3. Store the `destroy` function and clean it up when the element unmounts.

```ts
import { enhanceButton } from "@chamfer/behavior";

const destroy = enhanceButton(buttonElement, {
  ripple: true
});

// Later…
destroy();
```

Each helper documents its own options and lifecycle hooks. See the [Ripple guide](./ripple) for a complete walkthrough.

## Good citizens

- Always pair behaviors with semantic markup. They assume you rendered the correct element (`<button>`, `<a role="button">`, etc.).
- Keep the helper optional. Avoid breaking functionality if it isn’t initialised.
- Clean up when you remove the element; every helper returns a `destroy()` function for this purpose.
- Respect user settings. Helpers will already detect `prefers-reduced-motion`, but you can also toggle them via data attributes (`data-ch-ripple="false"`).

## What’s next

The behaviors layer will expand as components land. Upcoming work includes structured focus rings, async progress cues, and modal helpers. Track progress in the [roadmap](/reference/roadmap) or subscribe to release notes in the changelog.
