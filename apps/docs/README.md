# Chamfer Docs (Astro)

Planned documentation experience built with Astro. Goals:

- Static HTML generation for SEO + SSR islands where needed
- Framework-specific demos powered by Chamfer wrapper packages
- Versioned content with automated sitemap and metadata

> Status: not yet bootstrapped. Run `pnpm create astro` (when ready) using the existing workspace configuration.
