# @chamfer/behavior

Vanilla TypeScript progressive enhancement helpers for Chamfer UI components. Each helper augments native elements with advanced interaction (e.g., ripple, focus management) while respecting accessibility preferences such as reduced motion.

> Status: scaffolding only. Actual behaviors will land alongside the first component implementations.
