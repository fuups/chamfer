# @chamfer/tailwind

Tailwind CSS preset and plugin that maps Chamfer design tokens into Tailwind’s theming system. Planned features:

- `chamferTailwindPreset` for quick drop-in configuration of tokens (colors, spacing, radius, typography).
- `chamferTailwindPlugin` adding variants/utilities for intents, emphasis, density, high-contrast, and motion states.
- Optional CSS variable injection for environments where Chamfer’s base CSS is not yet loaded.

> Status: scaffolding only. Real token mappings will be generated once `@chamfer/tokens` is implemented.
